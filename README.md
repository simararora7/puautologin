# PU Auto Login

Unlike the existing tedious paradigm that needs you to give user name and password every time you connect to the Wi-Fi network, this application enables the facility of auto login. You just need to give your user name and password once, and after that the application will automatically fetch them and will provide a smooth login without any impediments. In order to reduce the complexity, you are not even required to press any button for logging in. Moreover you can add more than one user's information and connected with the desired one.
